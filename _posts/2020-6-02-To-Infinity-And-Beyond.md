It's always fun to look at the numerous images formed when sitting at a barbershop, or standing in a lift. But have you ever wondered:

## Do Mirrors Facing Each Other Produce Infinite Images?

Theoretically, yes. A set of ideal mirrors kept parallel will form an infinite number of images. As mentioned in a previous [post](https://aceking007.github.io/blog/The-Mirror/), mirrors in the real world are not perfect/ideal. They lose a tiny bit of light with each image that is formed by them. This leads to the images getting progressively dimmer.

Thus, in our practical world, it is not really true. The images get dimmer and dimmer along with the reflections and fade away till infinity without quite reaching it.

Today's post was quite short, but yeah, something's in life are simple :wink: !
