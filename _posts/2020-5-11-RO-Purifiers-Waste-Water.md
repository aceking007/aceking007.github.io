It's been sometime now, that I've been living with my uncle. He has an RO water purifier. I noticed the other day that there is an outlet for water from the RO. I was wondering what it was for?  
So today's question is:

## What is the outlet of water coming out of the RO?

After searching online and applying some scientific common sense, I found this:

In short, RO (or Reverse Osmosis) passes water through a semi permeable membrane by applying external pressure. This partitions the water into two halves, one with clean water and the other with impure water (water and all the salts). The impure water is "rejected" and drains out.

I was honestly a bit disheartened to know that RO wastes about three litres of water to purify just one litre of water. But I found some quite good sites where people describe ways to use the rejected water:
- [Quora link to answers](quora.com/How-do-I-save-and-reuse-the-waste-water-from-my-water-filter)
- [Clever ways to reuse RO water](https://www.thebetterindia.com/92731/5-ways-to-use-ro-wastewater/)
- [Innovative ways to reuse RO water](https://www.bestrowaterpurifier.in/blog/ways-to-use-ro-waste-water/)

Hope it helps you out! I'm also thinking of setting up something to prevent this water from going to waste here.
