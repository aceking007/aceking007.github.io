On March 24th all of a sudden, the GoI (Government of India) announced a 21-days lockdown all over India. It started effectively on 25th of March 2020. Since quite a long time before that, I have been on my college campus. Me and a few of my friends were debating if we should go home amidst the rise in cases when this announcement was made. We were officially and effectively stuck.  
There have been effects and largely side-effects of this whole lockdown on people at large including me and everyone who is stuck here at the campus. The first major impact was the closing down of places of eating excluding the institute run mess (and 1 canteen) as the people managing them either ran away or couldn't make it to the campus. Sanitation workers and many of the security guards aren't coming to campus anymore. The grocery shop inside campus stayed closed for sometime. Now, they are back with the essential food items like bread, milk, and eggs. The campus is weirdly empty even when people are there. Not many people come out now.  
The condition is not that bad though, our mess is open so we are provided with proper food. The WiFi is still working and thus I'm able to watch a lot of things and also blog like this. Me and some of my friends have been cooking also to pass time and also to get away from the routine stuff we get in the mess. We still play in the evenings or go out for random walks around the campus without any problems. At my home on the other hand, people don't go out. The police is beating up people who roam in the streets and recently it has started confiscating vehicles too. I've been thinking about doing something to help because I don't think I can last like this for long.

The news and WhatsApp groups seem to be concentrated on this one thing and thus, all I hear about from my family is about coronavirus. Sometimes it feels like it's not that bad and it is just a small disease that has been blown out of proportion. But the recent spike in the number of cases seems to be pretty serious. Suggest me things to do while I'm stuck here guys!
