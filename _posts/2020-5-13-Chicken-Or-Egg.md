The age old question still remains,

## Which Came First? The Chicken or the Egg?

As a joke I used to tell people, "what you order first in a restaurant." But now I have the knowledge (science, bitch!) and time (lockdown) to answer this bubbling question for everyone.

It's the egg.

Lemme explain. Long before the chicken came, there were organisms which used to lay eggs. After a long period of evolution, a little chick came out of the egg, and grew up to become a chicken. There is evidence for this whole theory and it is agreed upon to be a consequence of "Evolution". Interested people can read more about it from the links below:

- [Darwinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwinism)
- [Evolution](https://www.livescience.com/474-controversy-evolution-works.html)

P.S. For all those people angry coz I said bitch, it was a reference to Jesse Pinkman in Breaking Bad. Go and watch it!
