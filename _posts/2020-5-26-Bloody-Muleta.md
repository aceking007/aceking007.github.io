In the [last post](https://aceking007.github.io/blog/Red-Bull/), we found in bull fighting, bulls charge irrespective of the colour of the matador's cape (muleta). Naturally the next question that comes to the head is:

## Why Is the Muleta Red Anyways?

Bull fighting as you may (or may not) know it, is a gruesome sport. It is just as it sounds. A man and a bull *fight* each other, **till death**! Traditionally, there are three rounds in a bull fight. The small red cape (called the *muleta*) is used in the final round in conjunction with a sword.

The mission is simple; anger the bull by waving the cape, let it charge, pierce it with the sword and land the kill. The muleta is traditionally red to hide the *blood* from the wounded bull. Sounds gruesome and cruel, doesn't it? I still wonder why people engage in such acts. *But we all have our* **"traditions"**, *don't we?* Anyways, take care. Meet you tomorrow.
