It's been some time now since the world was struck with the infamous Chinese Coronavirus. Recently, the [WHO has declared the disease as a pandemic](https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020). The first few cases started appearing in India not long ago and there has been a steady rise in the number of cases since. People even speculate that a lot of the cases go unnoticed as many people don't have access to proper healthcare in India.  
Till now, the pandemic had not affected me personally, but now it has. Our institute has a break right after our second mid-semester examinations. The break was extended two days ago till the last day of this month, i.e., March. Many places are in lockdown and people are fearing to go outside. Many students have already fled from the campus in fear of catching the virus. Just some of my friends and me remain here. The whole thing seems like a zombie or apocalyptic movie where people from outside of campus will suddenly get infected by this virus and try to infect us. Then, we all have to secure the campus and stop the infection somehow. It may seem crazy, but I've been paranoid since sometime and I really can't decide if I should go back home amongst this commotion or just stay put.  
I can't get many things done, but I don't want to spread the infection as I'll be travelling and be susceptible to the infection and thus I may bring it home. In these few days, I have watched some interesting movies and also written some good (in my opinion at least) blog posts. I just hope the break doesn't get extended beyond this and things return to normal. I've recently thought of a movie idea though regarding this whole episode. It's a lot crazy but I think it's nice. I'll probably write a blog post regarding this.

See you next time! Meanwhile let me know how is this pandemic affecting you (if it is).
