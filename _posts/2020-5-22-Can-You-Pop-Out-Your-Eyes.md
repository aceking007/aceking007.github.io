There are just some questions that are really hard to not notice. I have always wanted to know what happens if someone tries to sneeze with their eyes open? I've tried it on several occasions, but all in vain. It's even difficult to imagine how one can do something like that.

## If You Sneeze With Eyes Open, Do They Pop Out?

Unlike what you read [here](https://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,5753,-16982,00.html), sneezing with open eyes won't cause the eyes to pop out. Closing of eyes when one sneezes is an autonomic reflex similar to the [Knee Jerk reflex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_wsNvZtcA4). Just before you sneeze, the brain sends a signal to the eyelids to close. This has led people to believe that the brain does this to prevent the eye from flying out of the socket.

Different parts and muscles of the body, including the diaphragm, throat muscles, chest muscles, abdominal muscles, combine to expel air quickly out of the nose during a sneeze. It is estimated that material leaving from the nose during a sneeze can travel up to 100 miles per hour.

There is a lot of pressure when you sneeze, but don't worry. First, the passageways connecting the muscles involved in a sneeze are not connected to the eye. Secondly, your eye muscles firmly hold the eye in place at all times. It is also important to notice, that your eyelids won't be able to hold you eyes back in place if they were to pop out! Finally, here is a [horrifying video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6qqlyIDHfM) of someone sneezing with open eyes.
