Movies have different kinds of actors. A lot of movies have little children and even newborn babies. Honestly, adopting a child everytime you make a movie isn't a great idea. Neither is using dummies. Still movies never stop amazing us with all the little stars in their sets. Look [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrLutFhQLgE) for an example. To my amusement, we discuss the question below today:

## How Do Movies And Shows Get Newborn Babies For Delivery Scenes?

We all fall for the little cute ones in the movies. But have you ever wondered where they come from? Apart from consent from the parents and filled up paperwork declaring the child is healthy and fit, a checkup is required before a baby can appear in front of the screen.  
There are agencies that handle such needs for movies. Generally the babies in movies aren't really "newborns" as they have to wait for the filing of paperwork before being eligible to play a part in the movies. The process usually takes few days to weeks.

However, there are severe restrictions on how much time the baby can spend on camera. Generally they are allowed for 5 hours on set, with a limit of 2 hours on "performing" in front of the camera. This combined with the fact that older babies (2-3 weeks) generally don't give the feel for newborns, often leads movies to cast twins in place of a single child. Twins are mostly premature, giving them the appearance of a younger child than their age. Also, they can be switched and tag teamed providing the possibility of a longer shoot.

In many cases, parents (or single pregnant women) can register with a given agency and enlist their due date and other details. This will lead to accelerated paperwork that in many cases lets babies work for movies as early as 3-4 days after birth.

After finding all this, it does feel like the movie industry has gone a bit too far to acquire babies. But the availability and eagerness of parents to let their newborn babies *perform* in movies and TV shows can't be neglected. Personally, I don't think one should expose their babies to other people or so many stressful circumstances just to make them famous or earn some money.
