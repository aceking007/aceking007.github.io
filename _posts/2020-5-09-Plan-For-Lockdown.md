I'm bored officially. I tried doing everything that I could during the lockdown, and now I have nothing more to do. Adding the fact that I can't get out of the house, I'm horribly bored. I did a lot of things, started a new blog, watched breaking bad, watched a dozen movies, learnt the electric guitar, broke the electric guitar (obviously the strings!), learnt the piano (a little), learned to cook (yummy), developed some games and most importantly, completed three online courses!

Now I am ready to move on to other things. I have been thinking for a while now to start some kind of a series that will make me post everyday in this blog. Initially, I thought it would be nice to write about coding. But now I feel this blog is a bit informal and I need to have an outlet for other things and feelings too!

I like to think of myself as observing and inquisitive. Thus, I have decided starting tomorrow, I'll post on the theme: Answer me everything! Basically I will think of a question today and try to answer it by tomorrow on my blog. I know it is not a new thing to try out as many people have done it a lot of times. But I promise you, mine will be a bit different for sure!

See you tomorrow with the first post in the series!
