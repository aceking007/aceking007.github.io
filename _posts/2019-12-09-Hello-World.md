**Hello World!**

I didn't know what else to write in the first post. This theme is actually modified from minimal-mistakes by Michael Rose. Its a very simple and nice Jekyll theme that can be customized easily.

This has been a very productive enterprise till now. I learnt using Jekyll a bit. I modified a GitHub repo from someone else and made it into an awesome website that I like plus I got to host it for free on github pages.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```python
def print_hi(name)
  print( "Hi, ",name)

print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```

This gives me a wonderful way to also share code snippets from when I code (which is very much). All this from the comfort of my github repository. Wonderful!
