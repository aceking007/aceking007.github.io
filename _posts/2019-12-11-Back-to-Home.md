Coming home after almost half a year. Still feel like something is missing (It's not TV though). I got plenty of TV to watch at home and without the power of 24x7 free WiFi (as found in college), its really a life-saver. I watched (or rather re-watched) two wonderful movies, "Drishyam" and "The Shawshank Redemption".

I first watched 'The Shawshank Redemption' when I was in 10th standard I guess, it was on TV. I used to watch a lot of english movies (I think that's where it all started). The movie is one of my all time favourites, it always makes me feel hopeful and wonderful. The story of an innocent man who ends up in prison, but doesn't give up on his dream and finally ends up in his dreamland. That's the man, everyone should strive to be.

I hadn't watched 'Drishyam' till very late I think. I don't remember when I first watched it. It's one of the best thrillers I have watched yet. It taught me a lot about how the mind works. I don't want to say much about it, go and watch if you want to find out (kudos if you have already).

Both the movies sparked a bit of things in me that I had left alone, a bit of hope, a bit of courage, and a bit of crazy passion. I'm not very good at ending posts, so yeah. That's all that I had to say. Maybe I'll update this post later (make it some kind of movie review if people want).
Do share if you have watched these movies and what you liked the most about them.
