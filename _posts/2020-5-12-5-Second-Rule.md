I dropped food while eating. It fell on the ground. I picked it up and ate it. Justified to myself that it was on the ground for less than 5 seconds so it was cool (may sound gross to some people, I know!). But is it?
So today's question is:

## Is the 5 second rule really true or just a myth?

It wasn't too difficult to dig this one out. As a famous myth, many people have tried to tackle it before. I just didn't notice it till now! So here are a few resources I came across:

- [DIY Science 5 second rule](https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/blog/eureka-lab/five-second-rule-myth-busted)
- [Mythbusters take](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2177147879222455)
- [Dropped Food Rule](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/five-second-helpings/)
- [Vsauce on the 5 second rule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYXdsOEWBj0)

Of all the videos, I liked the DIY science and Mythbusters take on it. It was a bit scientific. All of them go on to show that the 5 second rule is a myth. However, I do agree with vsauce. Everything out in the world, including us is laden with enormous amounts of bacteria.  
Even the plates/dishes on which we serve our food is not free of bacteria and other microbes. Facts don't shape people, rather it is our fact defying idiosyncratic beliefs and behaviors that define who we are. Thus, I'm still going to eat off the floor (of just my house) till it is maintained and clean! What about you?
