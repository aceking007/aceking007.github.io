After the kinda sad announcement [yesterday](https://aceking007.github.io/blog/The-End/) and pondering upon the question at hand, I think I should give all of the things a try before deciding what to do next. Since I don't really have much time, I'll first start with the experiment thingy. I'll also be posting some questions randomly on the side (but they will be a bit more casual or philosophical).

I've always been fascinated by science and its wonderful experiments. When I was younger, I wished to be someone like Michael Faraday. He's probably one of the reasons I strongly believed in experimental science compared to the theoretical aspects of science. And I think that's a joy that I want to share with the whole world.

So, the big announcement today is, starting today, I'll post an article every week on any random experiment related to any discipline of science that I find interesting. I hope to share my awe and enthusiasm for some of the experiments that have made me fall in love with science over the years.

I think the first post should be a bit special. It is something that I found very fascinating the first time I learnt about it. It is related to one of the deepest mysteries that science is yet to discover, the beginning of life! I'll shortly post the article for today, read it and enjoy!

P.S. I wonder if this will be a good name for this series of posts, *"Experimentalism"*. Suggest any better name if you have one.

P.P.S. I just need a name so that I can create a tag for these posts that will help you (and also me) find the posts easily later on.
