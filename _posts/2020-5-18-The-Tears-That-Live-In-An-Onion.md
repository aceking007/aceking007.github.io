I've started cooking recently. The only thing that is more annoying than forgetting to put salt, is the constant flow of tears while cutting an onion. So today's question is:

## Why Do Chopping Onions Make You Cry?

Turns out, the onion doesn't want other animals to eat it (nothing new. plants do this often, check out the [chilli](https://aceking007.github.io/blog/Hot-Stuff/)). Chopping an onion breaks down its cells and a reaction occurs as detailed below:
* Lachrymatory-factor synthase is released into the air
* The synthase enzyme converts the amino acids sulfoxides of the onion into sulfenic acid
* The unstable sulfenic acid rearranges itself into syn-propanethial-S-oxide
* Syn-propanethial-S-oxide gets into the air and comes in contact with our eyes
* The lachrymal glands become irritated and produces the tears!

Although it is very irritating, people have suggested ways to prevent it. Including this glorious invention:

From personal experience, wearing spectacles or goggles do help! Try it out the next time you cut an onion.
