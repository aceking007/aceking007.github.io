It's been a long time since I've been ignoring my body. I abuse my body a lot with random amount and quality of food and a very strainful life including irregular sleeping cycles. This has led to me realizing that I need to work on my body a bit. I like brain games, solving puzzles, riddles, and what-not, but now I realize that none of them are physical activities and thus I don't really take care of my body.  
The realization hit me when I was sitting in class and sir (Evolutionary biology) was discussing how our bodies are made for locomotion and not just sitting around and checking out our phones and laptops. I've decided on making a proper plan for diet and also exercise so that I engage more of my different body parts and take care of my nutrition. I personally don't think I am that fat, but my BMI is really close to Obese which I am targeting to change.

On a side note, I'm thinking of starting something like a YouTube channel or a dedicated blog where I would post quality content regarding coding and programming in general as I realize I am passionate about teaching and helping out people who want to begin coding. Also, I had a kind of a big dream to make a popular and helpful YouTube channel since some time now. I think its time I act on both these things. I'll post other updates here as I go through with them. The main thing that I am currently thinking of doing is writing general articles on medium, improving my coding skills and also making a proper demonstration kind of repository on biostatistics that help visualize statistics better.
