A greatly belated Happy New Year 2020 to everyone who is reading this blog!

Well, I'm not the one in for of abbreviations but I do like this particular one - HNY (because it is both Happy New Year and it sounds like I'm trying to say 'Honey'). I've been kind of busy till now. Well, now also I'm kind of busy but I just wanted to write at least one post this month, so yeah, I'm here now.

After returning from home to college I have not been able to stop thinking about new and crazy things and there are just more and more new things happening in my life at this moment and I'm kind of caught up in reacting and processing the information. As it was the new year, I made resolutions, some pretty standard ones like eating good and exercising which I have not been able to hold on to now and also some interesting ones too which till now I have been able to continue and I hope I do (fingers crossed!). One such resolution was to learn two things whole-heartedly: Deep Learning (also Machine Learning and other AI stuff) and Statistics. I've taken courses in both of them and those courses kind of sparked an interest in me. This made me think about it more and made me consider educating myself for the sake of it, not because I had to pass a test or score some marks. For now, I'm reading and solving questions in statistics (also currently enrolled in a course called Biostatistics) and also I have enrolled in an online course on data science on Grey Atom. I find that course quite interesting because of the way it is put up (the curriculum, notebooks, codes, study materials and cheat sheets). I'll talk more on that after I complete the course (I'll probably write a post on that course and if/how it helped me or made me understand certain things in a better way).

Lately, I've had a number of different interests and ideas spark up in my mind which I'm kind of overflowing with and would like to share to someone or write up somewhere. I find it difficult to maintain a hard copy like a diary or something so I thought I'll do it on this blog. I've recently logged in on medium and I'm thinking of writing up certain tutorials and basically theory kind of things as I feel that I understand better if I teach or write it up like that somewhere. It will be beneficial in two ways: I'll do something productive and also it will be available for my future reference (I tend to forget a lot of things I do).

I'll be writing mainly kind of informal stuffs here, including but not limited to things that I find interesting such as bats, bioacoustics, machine learning, biology in general. Now I've got to go, play some soccer (yeah I'm kind of trying to continue the exercising part of my resolution a bit). See ya later alligator.
