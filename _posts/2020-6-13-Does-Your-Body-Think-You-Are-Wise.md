Yesterday, we talked about teeth in general. Today, we focus on a particular type of teeth that supposedly come to only wise people :wink:.

## Why Do We Have Wisdom Teeth?

Wisdom teeth are the last set of molars that erupt when people are generally 17-21 years old. Some people get it sooner and some later.

As we saw [yesterday](https://aceking007.github.io/blog/Our-Dental-Society/), teeth are categorized by their function and placement. Sharper teeth helps in tearing food like meat and flatter teeth helps in grinding food. **Wisdom teeth, as mentioned earlier are a kind of molar (which are flatter teeth).**

It is speculated that our ancestors usually had to eat *harder* stuff (they didn't cook stuff or grow stuff till later). Thus, the extra set of molars helped in grinding the food. *Many archaeologists also think that the wisdom tooth served as a replacement in case one of the molars got broken while eating.*

Since most people get the teeth at the age of around 20, they are thought to be wiser by this time and thus, the teeth are called wisdom teeth. Although I have enough reason to doubt this, it seems to be the consensus among people.

There are a lot of people including some of my friends (and even me) who don't have all the wisdom teeth. Many a times, the teeth gets stuck inside the gums and never erupt. Thus, people generally have 0, 1, 2, 3, or, 4 wisdom teeth.

*The wisdom teeth are a vestige of our struggles for food. A bittersweet memory of our ancestors that still inhabits our genes.* Although it pains a lot when they come out, they do still help us remember the things that our ancestors had to face.
