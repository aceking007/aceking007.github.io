It's been quite sometime since I started writing posts on medium. The general topics tend to be related to statistics or programming with a few digressions like game and app development. I have always liked reading and writing new stuff. The blog business started when I realized that I no longer write as much as I used to. For me, writing provides a mental stimulation that few other academic and artistic activities can replicate. One fine day, about 7-8 years ago, I started writing a blog with much dedication. The main motive for writing that blog was to earn something. I had recently discovered that one can earn money by having a YouTube channel or writing a famous blog, I tried them both but didn't quite get to establish myself. The fact that I wasn't writing enough motivated content didn't bother me at that time as my primary goal was to publish stuff and get paid for the same. I was in my early teen years and it was just a rush.  
Now I realize, writing is much more that just writing any crap to earn money. Honestly, I have been struggling to write a good enough post on medium all this time. I know what I write is good but I never really thought it was good enough for the type of audience that I want to attract, which is other engaged and mathematically or programmatically inclined people.

So, this post comes after I got my first clap on medium from a fellow data science enthusiast. I really like the article for which I got the clap, I think everyone should have a look at [it](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/julia-vs-python-what-should-you-choose-bbb20647f406). To quote one of my all time favourite movies,  
>This part of my life... this little part.... is called "Happiness"

Finally, I think I am ready for something bigger. I have lots of plans, stick around coz its gonna be a hell of a ride, friends.
