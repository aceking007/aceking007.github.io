Are you also a fan of anime? Some of my favourites include One Piece, Monster, Naruto and Death Note. Yep, watched most of them (didn't really complete Naruto and One Piece, but I love till what I've seen). I have been playing physical sports a lot recently, including football (soccer not the American one) and volleyball. Most of the people (my friends) I play with are in general attracted to volleyball due to an anime that they have watched or are watching called haiykuu!  
Currently I am not that interested in watching stuff including TV series and anime (I'm on hiatus), so they pester me a lot but I don't really watch anything. Its kind of a break for my sanity, to preserve myself and prevent my brain from getting consumed by stuff like that. It feels a bit too much at times all this, the phones, the TV, the internet and everything else (don't worry I still love writing here and browsing YouTube from time to time). So, one of my friends sends me this link and the title seems interesting, ["If Programming was Anime"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKO9UjSeLew). Its a video from an Asian YouTuber by the name of Joma. I checked out the video and it was hilarious and so relatable! It was the perfect combination of anime and also the real life depiction of what generally happens when you sit to code. Check the video out if you haven't yet, I'm sure you would love it too if you are into both programming and anime.  
Exams are coming up and then I have holidays, yay! Hope I'll be able to write more concrete stuff soon.
