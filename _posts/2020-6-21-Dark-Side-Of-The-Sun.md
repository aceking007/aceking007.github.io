Today, many of us are seeing the solar eclipse. It's a big phenomenon for astrophysicists and also for the typical Indian Hindus (who have lots of myths associated with eclipses). So, today's article will be about the solar eclipse.

## What Causes Solar Eclipse?

An eclipse takes place when one heavenly body such as a moon or planet moves into the shadow of another heavenly body. There are two types of eclipses on Earth: an eclipse of the moon (lunar eclipse) and an eclipse of the sun (solar eclipse).

Sometimes when the moon orbits Earth, it moves between the sun and Earth. When this happens, the moon blocks the light of the sun from reaching Earth. This causes an eclipse of the sun, or solar eclipse. During a solar eclipse, the moon casts a shadow onto Earth.

There are three types of solar eclipses:

* The first is a **total solar eclipse**. A total solar eclipse is only visible from a small area on Earth. The people who see the total eclipse are in the center of the moon’s shadow when it hits Earth. The sky becomes very dark, as if it were night. For a total eclipse to take place, the sun, moon and Earth must be in a direct line.

* The second type of solar eclipse is a **partial solar eclipse**. This happens when the sun, moon and Earth are not exactly lined up. The sun appears to have a dark shadow on only a small part of its surface.

* The third type is an **annular solar eclipse**. An annular eclipse happens when the moon is farthest from Earth. Because the moon is farther away from Earth, it seems smaller. It does not block the entire view of the sun. The moon in front of the sun looks like a dark disk on top of a larger sun-colored disk. This creates what looks like a ring around the moon.

During a solar eclipse, the moon casts two shadows on Earth. The first shadow is called the umbra (um bruh). This shadow gets smaller as it reaches Earth. It is the dark center of the moon’s shadow. The second shadow is called the penumbra (pe num bruh). The penumbra gets larger as it reaches Earth. People standing in the penumbra will see a partial eclipse. People standing in the umbra will see a total eclipse.

Solar eclipses happen once every 18 months. Unlike lunar eclipses, solar eclipses only last for a few minutes.

Also, today is the longest day of the year, and father's day. Happy father's day to all you people out there and enjoy the sun today!

P.S. Never look at the sun directly with your naked eyes, it may cause permanent damage to your eyes. Use proper equipment while viewing an eclipse.
