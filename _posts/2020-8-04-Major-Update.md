Yes, I know, it was Monday yesterday and I didn't post as promised. Sorry to all my readers (if there are any except me :laughing:). I think I am going to discontinue with the trend. Hear me out though.

It just didn't feel like myself. The questions were a lot different, they were things that I really found interesting and I would search for their answers and satiate my curiosity along with writing a post daily. The experiment thingy wasn't really much enlightening for me. I realized this while I was typing out the Mendel (Genetics) post. It was way too long and it didn't feel like a thing I was glad to post on my blog. It wasn't short, crisp, or really that beautiful.

After that post, I tried to post shorter experiments and I am really glad for the last piece I wrote. It was beautiful and it was science in its most simplistic nature. But still, this task of writing about an experiment a day quickly became monotonous and more of an academic adventure that I needed the least at the moment.

The posts slowly became separated from me, they lacked the feel and joy that I wanted to express. Thus, I am thinking of taking an infinite hiatus (ya, I'm glad I know such a fancy word) from writing and posting for the "experimentalism" series. Meanwhile, let's start a discussion on the best things to do in the current lockdown/pandemic situation.
