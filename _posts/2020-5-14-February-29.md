What do you do on your birthday? My friends expect a lavish treat in addition to the number of beatings that I have to endure the night before. I have known some people who are born on February 29, and try to escape those cruel beatings on a tecnhicality. It makes me wonder:

## How Do You Calculate the Age of People Born on February 29?

Applying common sense, obviously those people age. Dates are just a construct of human civilization and not something natural. But what I was more interested to know is whether they have a different birthday legally? or is there any legal consequence of being born on that specific date?

A little bit of googling made me find stuff about it. The [people of Quora](https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-calculate-the-age-of-a-person-born-on-the-29th-of-February) answered that March 1st can be considered their birthday for all legal purposes. A large number of people celebrate their birthdays on Feb 28 or Mar 1 in non-leap years (time to give birthday bombs to those people who tried to escape before!).

However, it is not constant even legally. Wikipedia shows that different countries choose either Feb 28 or Mar 1 as legal birthdays of their residents. E.g., In Taiwan, legal birthday of a leapling (ya, that's what they are called) is on Feb 28, but in England it is March 1st.
