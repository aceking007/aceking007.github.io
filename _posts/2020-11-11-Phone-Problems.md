I wouldn't consider myself to be particularly lucky when it comes to phones. I destroyed the very first phone that I used to very small pieces (it was long back and I swear it was an experiment, sorry, I mean accident!). Lately, I have got robbed off my phone. But never before had something like this happened before (more on this in the next paragraph).

Since a few days my phone (a redmi device) kept on rebooting randomly. I read about it and found out that it was a perfectly normal thing (probably some software issue) that would be solved once I updated my firmware. Yesterday night, all of a sudden, my phone rebooted again. I expected it to be like the other random reboots, but to my surprise and disappointment, it started my initial setup for phone again.

I should have tried to restart or do something else probably, or rather stopped at that point and thought about what I was doing. But no, I had to be the expert and I had to go on with it. I went on and restored my backups and setup my device properly. Thus, I did all the hard work and restored my data from all the cloud backups that I had (honestly, just mi and google). It went smoothly, I had to spend about 4 GB of data and redownload a lot of apps and stuff, but it was smooth. Till I noticed it. **Yep, these things don't go as smooth as you think they should**. Anyways, everything was restored except my notes. Mi Notes. Ya that one.

I remembered that I had turned on sync and I had in fact backed up things. I restored my recordings too from the backups right. But when I logged in and checked, there were no backups for Notes after 11 Mar. Which is really frustrating. It bummed me out for the whole night and even for a major part of today. *I write a lot of stuff on notes, little ideas that I have for the blog, anything that I have to buy/get, story ideas (they all sound so well in my mind I promise) and other stuff (a bit personal too :wink:)*.

So anyways, I am currently done with all the sadness and I have decided not to use the app anymore. I'll probably use some other replacement or rather write stuff on real paper! The latter sounds pretty great to be honest. *It really reminds me of [The Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)) and particularly [Michael's advertisement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIUSPM7xjAk&ab_channel=TheOffice).*

But yeah, all the Office reference aside, I highly urge you people to create backups (both cloud and local) of all the data on your devices and test with restoring them from time to time. That's all I had to say, anyways, I'm still working on the simulation a bit and I'll write a nice article when it's all done.
