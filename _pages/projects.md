Here are some of the projects that I managed to host using GitHub Pages:

+ [Pictionary Word Generator](https://aceking007.github.io/pictionary_word_generator/) - Generates a random word from a predefined list of words without repeating words. Displays the word meaning in the webpage. I'm currently working on making this a bit more beautiful and improve functionality by adding in more lists from online. (Have to learn more CSS and Javascript)

+ [Basic Tetris](https://aceking007.github.io/Tetris/) - Second try at CSS and Javascript. A simple game of Tetris. The game features standard Tetris rotations and 7 Tetromino shapes. Currently working on improving the UI design of the page. Suggest me something!

Check out my pens and other short web projects on Codepen.io:

+ [Binary Calculator](https://codepen.io/aceking007/pen/xxwoQwM) - A Binary Calculator using Javascript. Hope one day a cyborg/android would use it (coz humans ain't that good with binary). P.S. I know cyborgs and androids don't need it though. But anyways.

+ [Beating heart](https://codepen.io/aceking007/pen/PoqbYLG) - A pure CSS animation of a beating heart.

+ [Ball and Fade](https://codepen.io/aceking007/pen/OJVbLvN) - Another pure CSS animation of two balls moving and fading on the screen.

More coming soon!
