Hi! I'm Arpit. Currently in my 4th year of BSMS dual degree at IISER Mohali majoring in biology.

I think of myself as an explorer; exploring myself, places and people around me. Music, Coding, Writing and Travelling are my hobbies. I find that progress of the human species happens when we communicate. This blog is an effort to share random thoughts, tweaks, life hacks and other stuff that I find interesting.

I heard that blogs help find like-minded people, so here I am. Tune in and follow me on social media to be updated and have lots of stuff to read in leisure. If you're interested in the same things as me, then do ping me!
