![Arpit Bio Photo](/assets/images/headshot_arpit.jpeg)

My name is Arpit. Currently in my 4th year of BSMS dual degree at IISER Mohali. I'm majoring in biology. I'll probably write some more about myself in the next update

I think of myself as an explorer, exploring myself, places and people around me. Music, Coding, Writing and Travelling are my hobbies. This blog is an effort to share random thoughts, tweaks, life hacks and just random stuff that I find online.

Tune in and follow me here and on social media to be updated and have lots of stuff to read in leisure. If you're interested in the same things as me, then do ping me!
